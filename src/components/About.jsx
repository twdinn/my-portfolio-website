      <p>
        I’m a Frontend Software Developer who studied Frontend Software
        Development at Keyin College and I am currently studying Full Stack
        Software Development at Get Coding. I’ve worked landscaping and manual
        labour jobs my whole life and I decided it was time to make a change and
        that’s when I started my developer journey.
